# PrecisionAgrilcultureAnalyticsSystem
Objective
This project focuses on collecting, processing, and analyzing agricultural data from IoT sensors and farmers to provide real-time insights for optimizing irrigation and crop health. <br>
 Key Features <br>
1️⃣ IoT Sensor Data Ingestion: Soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data collected from sensors. <br>
2️⃣ Farmer Input Collection: Farmers manually input crop type, irrigation method, and observations. <br>
3️⃣ Weather API Integration: External weather data (rainfall, temperature) is fetched to enhance decision-making. <br>
4️⃣ Big Data Processing (Apache Spark): Aggregates sensor and farmer data to generate insights. <br>
5️⃣ Analytics & Trends: System provides recommendations for irrigation and crop management. <br>
6️⃣ Interactive Frontend (React.js): Farmers input details and receive real-time insights (not just a dashboard). <br>
7️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform): Automates deployment of APIs, database, and Spark cluster.<br>
8️⃣ CI/CD with Jenkins: Automates build, test, and deployment processes. <br>
