# PrecisionAgrilcultureAnalyticsSystem
üìå Objective
This project focuses on collecting, processing, and analyzing agricultural data from IoT sensors and farmers to provide real-time insights for optimizing irrigation and crop health.
 Key Features
1Ô∏è‚É£ IoT Sensor Data Ingestion: Soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data collected from sensors.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Farmer Input Collection: Farmers manually input crop type, irrigation method, and observations.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Weather API Integration: External weather data (rainfall, temperature) is fetched to enhance decision-making.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Big Data Processing (Apache Spark): Aggregates sensor and farmer data to generate insights.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Analytics & Trends: System provides recommendations for irrigation and crop management.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Frontend (React.js): Farmers input details and receive real-time insights (not just a dashboard).
7Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform): Automates deployment of APIs, database, and Spark cluster.
8Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD with Jenkins: Automates build, test, and deployment processes.

üìå System Architecture
Data Ingestion Layer
Sensors send real-time data to Java Spring Boot API.
Farmers enter crop details via React.js UI.
Weather API pulls external data for rain prediction.
Processing & Storage Layer
Raw data is stored in PostgreSQL (Transactional DB).
Apache Spark processes sensor & farmer inputs for trends & insights.
Processed data stored in Parquet for analytics.
Frontend Interaction Layer
React UI allows manual data entry and shows recommendations.
Backend API retrieves processed data & trends for better decisions.
